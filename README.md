# Mathnote

This is the source code of the front-end of a web app that helps users improve their math skills using flashcards. It also facilitates taking notes containing mathematical formulas.
It provides many built-in flashcards in many areas of math, and for different proficiency levels.
It also allows users to create their own custom flashcards.
The app is built using React.js, and here is the [code link](https://github.com/hamzabow/mathnote-api) of the API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
